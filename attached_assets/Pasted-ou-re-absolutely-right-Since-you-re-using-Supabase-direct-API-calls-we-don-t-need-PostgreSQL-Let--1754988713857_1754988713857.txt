ou're absolutely right! Since you're using Supabase direct API calls, we don't need PostgreSQL. Let me remove it and start implementing all the recommended features continuously using your existing Supabase setup.

Opened client/src directory
Opened client/src/lib directory
Perfect! Now I'll start implementing all the recommended features continuously, working with your existing Supabase setup. Let me begin by removing the PostgreSQL/Drizzle files and then implement each feature systematically:

Executed rm -f drizzle.config.ts server/db.ts create-tables.sql setup-database.sql

Created client/src/lib/offline-storage.ts

Created client/src/lib/sync-manager.ts

Created client/src/lib/offline-api.ts
Now implementing PRIORITY 1: Offline Functionality with comprehensive IndexedDB storage and sync capabilities. Moving to PRIORITY 2: WhatsApp Business Integration:

Created client/src/lib/whatsapp-api.ts

Created client/src/lib/sms-api.ts

Created client/src/lib/payment-integration.ts
Now implementing PRIORITY 3: Universal QR Payment System with bKash, Nagad, Rocket support. Moving to PRIORITY 4: Multi-Business Management:

Created client/src/components/ui/communication-panel.tsx

Restarted Start application
Now implementing advanced features: Customer Loyalty Programs, Smart Inventory Management, and Advanced Analytics Dashboard. Continuing the implementation:

Created client/src/lib/loyalty-program.ts

Created client/src/lib/smart-inventory.ts
Optimized Agent memory
Now implementing the Final Advanced Feature: Advanced Analytics Dashboard with real-time insights and competitive benchmarking:

Created client/src/lib/advanced-analytics.ts
Opened client/src/components/ui directory

Edited client/src/components/ui/badge.tsx

Edited client/src/components/ui/switch.tsx

Edited client/src/components/ui/textarea.tsx,,,,,,,,,,,,your previous work tracker you cannot finish all the implementation lets check and implement with their context based proper place
