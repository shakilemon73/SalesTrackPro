## Project Overview
A comprehensive mobile-first business management application tailored for Bengali entrepreneurs, enabling efficient customer and sales tracking with robust offline-first functionality.

## Recent Changes (August 14, 2025)

### Hybrid Online/Offline System - Like TaliKhata/HishabPati (Latest)
**Completed Tasks:**
- ✅ **Hybrid Authentication**: First login requires internet, then works offline like TaliKhata
- ✅ **Hybrid Data Hooks**: Same components work online/offline with automatic sync
- ✅ **Network Status Detection**: Real-time online/offline status monitoring
- ✅ **Data Synchronization**: Online data syncs to local, offline uses local with sync queue
- ✅ **Connection Status UI**: Visual indicators showing online/offline mode
- ✅ **Same Page Architecture**: No separate offline pages, same UI for both modes

**Technical Implementation:**
- Created `hybrid-auth.ts` for TaliKhata-style authentication (internet for first login only)
- Implemented `use-hybrid-data.tsx` hooks that sync online data locally and use offline when needed
- Built `hybrid-auth-guard.tsx` for proper online/offline authentication flow
- Added `use-network-status.tsx` for real-time connection monitoring
- Updated dashboard with connection status indicators
- Integrated hybrid system with existing components

### Migration from Replit Agent to Replit Environment
**Completed Tasks:**
- ✅ **Package Installation**: Successfully installed all Node.js dependencies
- ✅ **Workflow Setup**: Configured and started the application workflow on port 5000
- ✅ **Routing Update**: Removed offline demo dashboard and set actual dashboard as default route
- ✅ **File Cleanup**: Removed dashboard-offline-demo.tsx file
- ✅ **Application Verification**: Confirmed app runs without errors in Replit environment

**Technical Changes:**
- Root route (`/`) now points to actual dashboard (DashboardMobileOptimized)
- Removed offline demo component import and file
- All package dependencies properly installed and working
- Vite development server running successfully

## Key Technologies
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **Backend**: Supabase for backend and authentication
- **Offline**: Service Worker + IndexedDB for full offline capability
- **State Management**: TanStack Query with offline persistence
- **PWA**: Complete Progressive Web App with manifest and service worker
- **Language**: Bengali (বাংলা) localization throughout

## Project Architecture

### Offline-First Strategy
The application now implements a comprehensive offline-first approach:

1. **Data Layer**: All API calls fallback to local IndexedDB storage
2. **Mutation Layer**: Create/Update operations work offline and sync later
3. **UI Layer**: Network status indicators and offline mode notifications
4. **Background Sync**: Automatic synchronization when connectivity returns

### Data Flow (Pure Offline-First)
```
User Action → Pure Offline Hook → 
└─ Always: Use Local Storage (IndexedDB + localStorage)
    ├─ Authentication: localStorage-based user sessions
    ├─ Business Data: IndexedDB for customers, sales, expenses
    └─ No Internet Dependency: All operations work offline-first
```

## User Preferences
- **Language**: Bengali (বাংলা) - All UI text in Bengali
- **Target Users**: Small business owners and entrepreneurs in Bangladesh
- **Mobile-First**: Optimized for mobile devices and touch interfaces
- **Offline-First**: Full functionality works without internet connection
- **Sync Strategy**: Background sync with visual progress indicators
- **Scalability Priority**: Confirmed need for unlimited feature expansion capability
- **Android APK Focus**: Production-ready Android app with native mobile experience

## Development Guidelines
- Always prioritize offline functionality over online-only features
- Use Bengali text for all user-facing strings
- Implement mobile-first responsive design patterns
- Ensure all data operations have offline fallbacks
- Display clear network status and sync progress to users
- Test offline functionality by disabling network in browser dev tools

## Testing Offline Functionality
To test the offline capabilities:
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab and check "Offline"  
3. Try creating customers, sales, expenses
4. All operations should work normally
5. Enable network - data should sync automatically

## Current Status
**PRODUCTION-READY PURE OFFLINE-FIRST ARCHITECTURE**

The application now operates completely offline without any internet dependency:
- ✅ **Complete Offline Operation**: All features work entirely without internet connection
- ✅ **Pure Offline Authentication**: User registration and login works offline-only
- ✅ **Local Data Persistence**: All business data stored in browser's IndexedDB and localStorage
- ✅ **Offline-First Components**: Dashboard, sales entry, customer management work offline
- ✅ **Mobile-Optimized**: Bengali interface optimized for mobile devices
- ✅ **Android APK Ready**: Complete Capacitor configuration for native Android deployment

**Pure Offline Implementation**: The app now functions as a true offline-first application where users can:
- Create offline accounts and login without internet
- Manage customers completely offline  
- Record sales and track business operations offline
- View dashboard and analytics offline
- All data persists locally on the device

## Next Steps
- User acceptance testing of offline functionality
- Performance optimization for large offline datasets
- Advanced conflict resolution for concurrent edits
- Offline-to-offline device synchronization via QR codes or Bluetooth
