## Project Architecture

### Offline-First Strategy
The application now implements a comprehensive offline-first approach:

1. **Data Layer**: All API calls fallback to local IndexedDB storage
2. **Mutation Layer**: Create/Update operations work offline and sync later
3. **UI Layer**: Network status indicators and offline mode notifications
4. **Background Sync**: Automatic synchronization when connectivity returns

### Data Flow (Pure Offline-First)
```
User Action ‚Üí Pure Offline Hook ‚Üí 
‚îî‚îÄ Always: Use Local Storage (IndexedDB + localStorage)
    ‚îú‚îÄ Authentication: localStorage-based user sessions
    ‚îú‚îÄ Business Data: IndexedDB for customers, sales, expenses
    ‚îî‚îÄ No Internet Dependency: All operations work offline-first
```

## User Preferences
- **Language**: Bengali (‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶≤‡¶æ) - All UI text in Bengali
- **Target Users**: Small business owners and entrepreneurs in Bangladesh
- **Mobile-First**: Optimized for mobile devices and touch interfaces
- **Offline-First**: Full functionality works without internet connection
- **Sync Strategy**: Background sync with visual progress indicators
- **Scalability Priority**: Confirmed need for unlimited feature expansion capability
- **Android APK Focus**: Production-ready Android app with native mobile experience

## Development Guidelines
- Always prioritize offline functionality over online-only features
- Use Bengali text for all user-facing strings
- Implement mobile-first responsive design patterns
- Ensure all data operations have offline fallbacks
- Display clear network status and sync progress to users
- Test offline functionality by disabling network in browser dev tools

## Testing Offline Functionality
To test the offline capabilities:
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab and check "Offline"  
3. Try creating customers, sales, expenses
4. All operations should work normally
5. Enable network - data should sync automatically
